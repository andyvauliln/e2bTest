The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts for the application. It is referenced by all other files that require external packages.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript. It is referenced by all .tsx files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is a custom App component. It initializes pages and is used across all pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is a custom Document component. It is used across all pages for setting up common layout like headers, footers, etc.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are used across all pages in the application.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is the favicon for the application and is used in the _document.tsx file.

10. **.gitignore**: This file lists the files and directories that Git should ignore. It is used by the Git version control system.

11. **README.md**: This file contains information about the application and its setup. It doesn't share dependencies with other files but is important for documentation.

Note: As the user's prompt doesn't provide specific details about the application's functionality, the exact names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names cannot be determined.
